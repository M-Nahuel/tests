# Word Shuffler

### Cna yuo raed tihs?

Olny 55 plepoe out of 100 can.

TL;DR:
Switch the middle letters of the words in a plain text.
e.g. `the following text will be shuffled` > `teh folwolnig txet wlil be suhflefd`

I came across this meme on social media and thought I could use it as a new method to improve my English reading, so I made this app to give it a try. I must say, as an English learner it actually works wonders for me!

`fi yuo cna raed tihs, yuo hvae a sgtrane mnid too. I cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg. The pehonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid, aoccdrnig to a rseaecrh at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it dseno't mtaetr in waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are, the olny iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can sitll raed it whotuit a pboerlm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Azanmig huh? Yaeh and I Awlyas tghuhot slpeling was ipmoratnt!`
